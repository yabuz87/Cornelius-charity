        "description":"Since 2012, CCO has built 12 water institutions in Amhara region, North Gondar zone, Chilga Wereda diffenrent villages. It is estimated that more than 3000 rural people benefited from these water institutions.The reason why CCO focused on provision of clean and safe water to rural population is because of the adverse effect of water borne diseases that hinders the development progress of a given society as a result of sickness and death without adding any value to a nation’s development. Water borne diseases are the major cause that reduce productivity in rural part of the country.",
        "readMore":"In addition, rural women and female children are victims of water shortage in rural area. They are responsible for provision of water to family. They travel long distances to collect water and this brings wastage of time which will be used to education or other income generating activities. Moreover, women are exposed to other social problems like rape and attack by wild beasts when they travel long distance to fetch water from rivers and springs located very far from their living area.   Female children are also victims of this problem. They spend their precious time in collecting water which otherwise will be invested in education for their bright future. Because of this, life in rural area is vicious circle of poverty without any chance of exposition to modern life.All these problems could be alleviated if there is provision of clean and safe water in the vicinity of their living area. Women could be prevented from rape and attack by wild beasts and will be engaged in other income generating activities that can improve their life standard. Female children will also get chance to go to school. "
